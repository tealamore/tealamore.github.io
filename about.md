As you can see from the bar above, my name is Brad. I am a full-stack software engineer at Kroger. My current team specilizes in the ingestion of several hundreds of GB per day to provide a personalized experience.

### Technologies

As of late, I've been working primarily in Java, Kotlin, React.js, and Python. Outside of my current positon, I've also worked in and still miss C#.

## Outside of work

I'm a fan of traveling and moving to new places. Also, in my free time, I love making various desserts and occasionally a nice loaf of bread. You can totally send me a recipe of yours and I will make it!
