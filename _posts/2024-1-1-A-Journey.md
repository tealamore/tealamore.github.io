Over this winter break, I went on a multi-hour road trip and while on this journey I was listening to some podcasts and began wondering about ad detection and ad blocking. 

So at home, you can use a browser-based ad blocker or even a DNS ad blocker, like [pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net/). And on youtube, there's [sponsorblock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/) which is crowdsourced data and skips, well, sponsored parts of videos. But upon googling, there's not really something like this for podcasts. So that's why we're here. 

## Ethics

I do want to acknowledge the ethics of this. Ad blocking normally has the justification that ads still sometimes serve malware and thus that's ethical to protect yourself against, but blocking someone from talking about some VPN service? I'm not sure how to argue that that is ethical. I guess like if I'm reading a book, I'm allowed to skip a page so why not videos? 

So with that said, I don't foresee this project becoming a product that's publicly available and I'm treating it more like a learning opportunity.
